# The application layer

What this service *does*, said once: the use cases — command handlers, query handlers, projection
definitions — and the ports they are driven through.

Ports go under `ports/`. Where this project was given an event store, two are already there: the events
port every write goes through, and the read-models port — the checkpoint and projection port the read side
is maintained with. Adapters under `../adapters/driven/` implement a port;
adapters under `../adapters/driving/` call a use case. Neither is an import from here.

**What belongs here.** A use case that orchestrates: load what the decision needs through a port, call
the domain, append what it returned. A port is an interface named for what the application needs, never
for what implements it.

**What it may not import**, enforced by `make check-imports`:

- anything under `adapters/`, `composition/`, `infrastructure/` or `delivery/`. An adapter is injected,
  never reached for, and the composition root — `../main.ts` where this project has one — is the only
  place a port and its implementation meet.

It may import the domain freely: that is the direction the whole rule exists to keep.
